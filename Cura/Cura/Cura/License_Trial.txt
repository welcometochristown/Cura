TRIAL VERSION LICENSE
END-USER LICENSE AGREEMENT
For Cura Management Software
By Christopher Townsend

IMPORTANT! READ CAREFULLY:

This End-User License Agreement (“EULA”) is a legal agreement between you (either an individual or a single entity) and Christopher Townsend for Cura later referred to as “the Software”. The Software under the Trial Version License can be either a fully functional time-limited version or a feature-limited version, or a combination of these two types. Detailed description of the Trial Version restrictions is available on CuraManage web site and in each product’s user-guide.

The Software under this License is provided free of charge only until it is a TRIAL VERSION.

“Trial Version” means a version of the Software to be used only to review, demonstrate and evaluate the Software for an unlimited time period. The Trial Version may have limited features and may lack the ability for the end-user to save the end product.

All Christopher Townsend Software products are shareware. It means that You can download the Trial Version for evaluation and, if You like the product, order the license. I.e. You can try before You buy. The functional peculiarities present in the Trial Version may not be a reason for refund request of a purchased license. If a Trial Version is a time-limited fully-functional version, allowing You to see and test all the features, your refund request will be declined if based on the absence of some certain feature or if some feature doesn’t work as You expected it to work. All other refund cases are regulated by Christopher Townsend.

Even though a license fee is not paid for the use of Trial Version software, it does not mean that there are no conditions for using such software.

This Software is copyrighted and the owner of the copyright claims all exclusive rights to such software.

By installing, copying, or otherwise using the Software You agree to be bound by the terms of this EULA. If You do not agree to the terms of this EULA, do not install or use the Software.
